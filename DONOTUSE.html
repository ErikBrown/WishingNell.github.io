Content Drafting: 

Working with Janelle Young was effortless and pleasant! She was eager to work with feedback and try multiple approaches to give each line the right impact-- plus she able to bring her own imagination to the table while working within direction at the same time.

I couldn’t have asked for an easier person to work with. Janelle voiced a monster in my short film and her performance was amazing. She took direction well and was always quick to respond to emails. I would not hesitate to work with her again should the opportunity arise. couldn’t have asked for an easier person to work with.
